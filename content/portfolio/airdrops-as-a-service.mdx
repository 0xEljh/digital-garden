Early engineer at Pacts, building the infrastructure for anti-sybil airdrop campaigns.

I owned the frontend, built both the web app and telegram bot. I also wrote the reward caclulation service that determines how rewards are distributed to users.
This was a mutually beneficial system that processed on-chain activity and allowed protocols to target desirable demographics, and for users to monitor their eligibility and rewards for airdrops.
