Joined Pacts, a pre-seed startup offering points-based airdrop campaigns as a service. As an early engineer, I contributed to building our unified platform for on-chain ID, activity tracking, and reward distribution. This enabled protocols to target curated, non-sybil users while providing a seamless experience for end users. My work included developing the frontend for the web app, creating a Telegram bot as an additional user interface, and implementing the reward calculation system to ensure accurate and efficient distributions based on user on-chain activity.
