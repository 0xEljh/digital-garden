At DSO, a defence research laboratory, I developed a Python-based finite element solver to model opto-acoustic interactions (Brillouin scattering) in high-powered laser fibres.
This tool facilitated the design of fibres with reduced power loss from backscattering and was selected for showcase from a cohort of forty.
