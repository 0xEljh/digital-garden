Won #1 Dashboard at ETHTokyo 2023 as a solo entry, built in under 24 hours.

1inch Fusion swaps use resolvers to execute trades. After discusions with the 1inch team, I learned that they wanted to better map out and understand resolver economics.
So I built these analytics to expose:
  - USD profit per resolver transaction
  - True trading volume (removed double-counting on intermediate swaps)
  - Gas costs and internal transaction breakdowns

The constraints of the hackathon (having little time left, poor WiFi, etc.) helped to facilitate most of the design decisions:
  - Using Etherscan over Dune because the structure of the data was closer to our desired shape.
  - Using DefiLlama for token price and metadata to reduce request counts over a slow internet.
  - Shipping just a Jupyter Notebook instead of a frontend UI to focus on the quality and coverage of the analytics.

All these practical decisions contributed towards shipping a functional and useful (although ugly-looking) product at the end of the hackathon.
