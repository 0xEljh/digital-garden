## Project Overview

After a last-minute decision to pivot and go solo, and with less than 1 day left in the hackathon, I decided to keep it simple and play to my strengths by building a dashboard for 1inch Fusion Swaps.
This barebones dashboard achieves its primary goal of obtaining the profits made by resolvers (the executors of Fusion swap trades), the gas fees paid in the process, and the "true volume" generated by swaps.

This project is the final result of on-chain exploration of the Fusion Swap mechanism and resolvers. To avoid using overly dirty scrapping methods in this hackathon, we query the data via Etherscan's API. Etherscan had the data more intuitively structured for this analysis than Dune, hence this choice. Information on the ERC20 tokens and their prices was also needed, so the DeFillama historical price api was also used, especially since it supports queries via the ERC20 token address, while providing us with all the metadata like decimals, symbol, etc, hence avoiding direct eth_calls or contract calls in this poor WiFi hackathon environment.

This proof-of-concept level dashboard (just a jupyter notebook file) presents on-chain analytics of resolvers behaviour on 1inch's fusion swap, including:

- USD profit for each resolver transaction
- USD "true volume" from each resolver (no double counts on intermediate swaps)
- gas fees paid
- internal transactions made during a settlement
