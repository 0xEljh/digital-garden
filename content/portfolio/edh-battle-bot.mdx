A Telegram bot to track wins, losses, and statistics in your EDH/Commander Magic: The Gathering pods!
[Fully open source](https://github.com/0xEljh/edh-telegram-bot)

## Backstory
Last year my playgroup decided to try something fun: we started logging our games and wins, which started weekly goading/banter over who's been rising up the leaderboard and culminated in a little Christmas giveaway where we gave our top player a human-sized goose stuffed toy.

All this logging was done by one person who maintained a complete spreadsheet of our games. And so I thought: it would be wonderful if I could make a simple bot for this. Hence, this telegram to log games in your pod!
