A Telegram bot for tracking Commander/EDH game stats.
[Fully open source](https://github.com/0xEljh/edh-telegram-bot)

My playgroup was tracking games manually in a spreadsheet as part of some friendly competition and a Christmas giveaway (which included a human-sized toy goose).
This was a lot for one person to handle, and involved a lot of post-game coordination to keep track of everything.

So I wrote this bot to automate that. The bot tracks games, win rates, and weekly/all time leaderboards.
It's meant to facilitate banter, pre-game goading, and debates about the pod arch-enemy before and after games.
