The news cycle is >90% noise, ragebait, and designed to take up your attention. Hence, this filter.

This was also my first "GPT-wrapper" project.

It ingests RSS feeds from various notable news sources: CNA (Channel News Asia), BBC, etc. and attempts to summarize, score, and "de-noise" them.

Unfortunately, I've sunset this project for now because it was a $40/month API bill, while the better alternative was still to categorically not consume any news.
I also didn't have a good solution for not encoding my own biases into the filtering process.
