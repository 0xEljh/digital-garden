Researched the use of post-quantum encryption (FHE, MPC, etc.) in deep learning.

This was my second internship, this time at A*star, another national research lab. It was also in the middle of COVID lockdowns.

Most of this project was experimenting with and benchmarking different frameworks and implementations (like SCALE-MAMBA) in deep learning related use-cases.
