Inspired by the extensibility and clean abstractions in Pytorch-lightning, this is a developer-centric backtester (most others tend to be for traders-turned-developers) that is event driven and aims to allow trading strategies to be backtested as-is relative to its forward tested counterpart.
It is highly extensible through callback hooks and supports (expects even) models for pricing/slippage, margin management, etc.
