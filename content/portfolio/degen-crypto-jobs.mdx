A crypto job board that grew to 15k Telegram subscribers and 10k monthly visitors.

Built on the T3 stack (NextJS, TanQuery, Prisma, Supabase) with a Python backend.

The real work for this was in distribution and user analytics: usage-analytics-driven insights and feature development, alongside lots of SEO optimisation.
